    Welcome to Edwin Clott's page! =]
    <p> On a personal note, I'm a proud husband and father to a lively eight-year-old daughter. I usually spend all my free time with the family while enjoying the island life. It is unique, to say the least.  I am a huge computer gamer as most of us are, and I just started playing Cities Skyline II. I am enjoying it so far as simulation-type games are among my favorite.

Upon graduation, I aim to transition into the tech industry, preferably in a role that allows me to leverage my security clearance. While I have valued my time serving in the military, I'm excited to explore new challenges. In a perfect world, I would work a remote role or with/for a defense company such as Boeing or Northrop Grumman, but I'm also open to anything really.  The program at Southwestern College is crucial in this transition, providing a solid foundation in programming and differentiating me from my peers. </p>

    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>The most important thing to know about me is I'm a proud husband and father. I usually spend all my free time with my family while enjoying the island life here in Hawaii. It is unique, to say the least.  I am a huge computer gamer as most of us are, and I just started playing Cities Skyline II. I am enjoying it so far as simulation-type games are among my favorite. </p>

<p>In addition to playing games and enjoying the island life in Hawaii, I also enjoy riding electric scooters with my 9-year-old daughter. Lately, electric bikes and scooters have become very popular and I must say I am also a fan. We had a great time riding around the island while enjoying the fresh air and ocean breezes. I will provide a few links below of my type of scooter, my favorite games that I play, as well as my favorite outdoor spot that I have visited so far here in Hawaii. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments :) </p>

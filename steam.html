Steam and Gaming Overview

Introduction:
Aloha, my Steam profile is linked below. I have played computer games for over a decade and would consider myself a seasoned pc gamer. My journey through this vast gaming universe began on Dec, 09, and since then, my thirst for gaming has never dwindled. 

Gaming Style and Preferences:
In this grand scheme, my gaming preferences have evolved like a finely tuned strategy in a game of chess. I thrive in the heart-pounding action of FPS games, such as Call of Duty. As well as relish the intricate strategies of RPGs, and occasionally enjoy the whimsical charm of small indie games. Each title in my library is a chapter in my gaming legacy, a unique experience that has shaped my life's journey.

Community and Connections:
One of the best things about having a Steam profile is the real-life connection it adds to the people I have called friends over the years. Some new friends that I have encountered in my years of military service, as well as old friends from before entering the services or starting a family. Steam is an excellent way to stay connected with those folks.

Additionally:
If you have yet to try PC gaming or gaming in general, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try. Not only can it be a rewarding hobby but it can help you connect with others in a way that may not be possible during the normal flow of life and work. For me, I remain in close ties with my friends as well as find common interests with my child. One more way to spend time with her.
